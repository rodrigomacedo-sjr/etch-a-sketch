# Insights

The grid was not obvious at first. `css-tricks.com` came in really handy.

The hover effect was also not obvious, getting the time just right makes a difference too.

The button to generate new grid was simple, the trick to remove all childs feels smart, but I'm not sure if it is the best way.

Generating random RGB values seems perfect, really proud of this one.

About the darkening effect, it is not 100% as TOP says, I didn't want the squares to be invisible at the beginning, I may be able to think about a solution to this at somepoint. Maybe having a border around a blank square, then removing the border when coloring it for the first time...
